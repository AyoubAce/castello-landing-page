# Castello - restaurant Landing page
Menu and images are fetched from castello-cms repository (which the admin can CRUD the menu and images)


#### Link 
https://castello-kamplintfort.netlify.app/


###### on load
menu page and images might take some time untill they load because of HEROKU DYNOS (free deployment plan 550h/month so Heroku puts the website to sleep after 30 min of inactivity). // it's not a bug :)
