# Castello - restaurant Landing page
Menu and images are fetched from castello-cms repository (which the admin can CRUD the menu and images)


#### Link 
https://castello-kamplintfort.netlify.app/


##### Clarification!
The Menu page and Galery page might take some time untill they load because the api is hosted on Heroku.
HEROKU DYNOS - free deployment plan 550h/month so Heroku puts the website to sleep after 30 min of inactivity to preserve the dyno hours from burning out or wasting). 
// it's not a bug :)
